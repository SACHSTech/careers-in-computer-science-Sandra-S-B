## Careers in Computer Science:
# Video Game Developer
A **video game developer** is someone who utilizes code to create video games. Many different careers overlap in game development (art, graphic design, narrative development, computer science). Depending on the preferred career, the responsibilities involved in game development can be vastly different. From a computer science perspective, game development means using programming to create entertaining and interactive games for a variety of consoles and devices. 

Responsibilities can include debugging and optimizing programs, translating game concepts to code using programming languages, and utilizing an understanding of user interface and user experience to enhance the interactivity of video games.

Game Developers also require a pleathora of skils to fulfill their duties.

*Technical Skills*:
- Proficiency in a variety of programming languages (C#, C++, Python)
- Previous experience in game development
- Understanding of other concepts of video games (this can include knowledge of 3D computer graphics, real-time animation, machine learning)

*Non-Techincal Skills*:
- Strategic Leadership
- Strong Communication
- Good Emotion Management (remaining calm in stressful situations)
- Creative problem solving (understanding different perspectives to solve a problem)
- Strong collaborative skills (knowing how to productively and politely interact with a team)

## Experiential learning

Although university or college can teach students the techincal skills they'll require in the workplace, there are many lessons that can only be learned through experience! The following are examples of how to gain this experience outside of a typical job.

Examples | In General... | In Game Development...
--- | --- | ---
Co-op | Co-op allows students to participate in the workplace, despite a lack of skills. Many schools use their reputable co-op programs to grant students the opportunity to learn skills that they would not have gained through traditional schooling. Students in university are also paid for the work they perform in their jobs. | For a career in video game development, a co-op position can be beneficial, as many jobs require some level of experience. Although it may be difficult to find a co-op position for a video game project, there are many positions that allow people to harness their coding skills in other areas. For example, York University provides co-op in their computer science program. On their website, they advertise the connections formed and lessons learned through the experience. They also explain their different types of co-op, including entrepreneurial co-op, co-op for change, LURA & URSA, and international co-op.
Social Clubs | Clubs bring people with similar interests and goals together. Whether it’s within schools, or outside of them, it’s always possible to find a group of people who share your passions. Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can teach you new concepts about the topic you love, let you develop stronger social and communicative skills, and even provide the chance to work on projects with a large group. | For a career in video game development, a club relating to computer science or coding video games can be beneficial. In these clubs, you can network and interact with other passionate people involved in computer science. Through this, you can not only strengthen your technical skills, but also enhance soft skills like leadership, organization and communication. One club for computer science can be found at York in their Computing Students Hub organization. They serve as a community for students involved in computer science at york. Such a community is beneficial for students to connect with new friends, and learn more about what they love.
Personal Projects | Personal projects are completely unique and explorative. Without restrictions set by employers or programs, people can use personal projects to explore interests without risk of getting fired or receiving a poor grade. They can provide an excellent opportunity to practice independent or group work, discover new talents and interests, and devote time to an enjoyable activity. | For a career in video game development, personal projects can mean developing your own game! Games can take many forms, and a personal project lets people decide what type of game they may or may not like to make. As well, they give people technical experience that can help them further in their careers. Many video games began as personal projects. For instance, Minecraft was initially created by Markus “Notch” Persson in 2009. He was inspired by Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress and decided to make his own game.
