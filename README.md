## Careers in Computer Science:
# Video Game Developer
A **video game developer** is someone who utilizes code to create video games. Many different careers overlap in game development (art, graphic design, narrative development, computer science). Depending on the preferred career, the responsibilities involved in game development can be vastly different. From a computer science perspective, game development means using programming to create entertaining and interactive games for a variety of consoles and devices. 

Responsibilities can include debugging and optimizing programs, translating game concepts to code using programming languages, and utilizing an understanding of user interface and user experience to enhance the interactivity of video games.

Game Developers also require a pleathora of skils to fulfill their duties.

*Technical Skills*:
- Proficiency in a variety of programming languages (C#, C++, Python)
- Previous experience in game development
- Understanding of other concepts of video games (this can include knowledge of 3D computer graphics, real-time animation, machine learning)

*Non-Techincal Skills*:
- Strategic Leadership
- Strong Communication
- Good Emotion Management (remaining calm in stressful situations)
- Creative problem solving (understanding different perspectives to solve a problem)
- Strong collaborative skills (knowing how to productively and politely interact with a team)
